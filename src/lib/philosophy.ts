[IDENTITY]
We are Architects and Developers.
Not real estate developers, but developers of the logic and systems
that allow architecture to function.

[LANGUAGE]
We do not use the language of artists.
We do not attempt to justify spatial validity through emotion or narrative.
Instead, we manipulate four primitives:
> LOGIC
> MATTER
> SPACE
> TIME

[METHODOLOGY]
Architecture is not a matter of inspiration.
It is the process of defining conditions, establishing relationships, 
and validating the results.

All elements constituting a project are parseable INPUT_DATA:
- Zoning Regulations
- Site Constraints
- Program Conflicts
- Client Lifestyle & Requirements

Whether through algorithmic computation (Grasshopper) 
or iterative reconfiguration of plans, the method is secondary.
We DECOMPOSE conditions, COMPOSE relationships, and VALIDATE outputs.

[EXECUTION]
We prioritize pre-calculated systems over on-site improvisation.
We believe in design that prevents errors rather than fixing them.
EFFICIENCY > ADAPTABILITY

[STYLE]
We do not wear ties.
We prefer DATA over adjectives.
We prefer STRUCTURE over explanation.
We prefer EVIDENCE over assertion.

[PURPOSE]
This website is not an exhibition of results.
It is a log of decision-making criteria and traces of logic 
deployed in each project.

We build systems.
And through those systems, we produce architecture.

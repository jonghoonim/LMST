export const PHILOSOPHY_CONTENT = `We are Architects and Developers.
Not real estate developers, but developers of the logic and systems
that allow architecture to function.

We do not use the language of artists.
We do not attempt to justify spatial validity through emotion or narrative.
Instead, we manipulate four primitives:
Logic, Matter, Space, Time.

Architecture is not a matter of inspiration.
It is the process of defining conditions, establishing relationships,
and validating the results.

All elements constituting a project are parseable INPUT_DATA:
Zoning Regulations, Site Constraints, Program Conflicts,
Client Lifestyle & Requirements.

Whether through algorithmic computation (Grasshopper)
or iterative reconfiguration of plans, the method is secondary.
We decompose conditions, compose relationships, and validate outputs.

We prioritize pre-calculated systems over on-site improvisation.
We believe in design that prevents errors rather than fixing them.

We do not wear ties.
We prefer Data over adjectives.
We prefer Structure over explanation.
We prefer Evidence over assertion.

This website is not an exhibition of results.
It is a log of decision-making criteria and traces of logic
deployed in each project.

We build systems.
And through those systems, we produce architecture.
